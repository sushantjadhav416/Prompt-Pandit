# 🚀 PromptPandit
### Gen-AI Based Smart Prompt Builder Application

PromptPandit is a **GenAI-powered prompt engineering application** built using **Vibe Coding principles**.  
It helps users transform vague ideas into **clear, structured, high-quality prompts** optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as **GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, DALLE**, and more.

Instead of guessing *how to talk to AI*, PromptSmith acts as a **Prompt Writing Agent** that understands intent, context, constraints, and output style—then generates prompts that actually work.

## 🧠 What Is Vibe Coding?

**Vibe Coding** is a modern development approach where:
- AI is used as a **thinking partner**, not just a code generator
- The focus is on **intent → structure → refinement**
- The developer guides the system with **clear mental models**, feedback loops, and iteration

PromptSmith is both:
- a **product built using Vibe Coding**, and  
- a **tool that teaches better Vibe Coding through better prompts**
